               <li>Select the Orientation of the Range<uL><li>Avoid shooting into the sun by facing North.</li>

<li>The ground should be flat and free of obstacles.</li>
<li>Look for a natural backstop such as a berm to
stop BB’s, or a ballistic cloth or double layer,
heavy duty tarp capable of stopping a bb as a
trap. If there is no berm, provide a minimum
of 195 yards of open area behind the targets.</li>
<li>The safety zone on the side should be 30-50 feet.</li>
</uL></li>
<li>Place Range and Safety Lines
  <ul>
    <li>Rope, eco-friendly spray paint or chalk are
ways to lay down the range lines outdoors.
Follow the guidelines illustrated on the fol-
lowing page.</li>
<li>Shooting Line – The Shooting Line is between
15-30 feet from the Target Line depending on
the skill level of the participants.
</li>
<li>Waiting Line – Shooters stand behind the
Waiting Line before and after shooting their
arrows. It is meant to act as a safety area
between the class and the Shooting Line. The
Waiting Line is placed 15 feet behind the
Shooting Line.
</li>
<li>OPTIONAL: Controlled Access/Spectator
Line – Anyone who wants to watch partici-
pants shoot can gather behind this line. This
line needs to be placed far enough behind the
Waiting Line to prevent distraction from the
spectators (at minimum 15 feet)
</li></ul></li>
<li>Set Up Targets
<ul>
  <li>Place targets in front of the natural berm. If a
natural berm is not available, place targets in a
wide-open space with a minimum safety zone
of 150 feet behind the targets.
</li>
<li>Evenly space targets in front of the berm.
Space between targets is dependent on place-
ment of shooting positions.</li>
<li>One method of hanging targets is to put up
posts to hold “snow fence.” Attach the snow
fence to the posts. Targets can be attached to
the snow fence with clothes pins.
</li><li>A temporary target holder can be made using
old political signs with their wire ground
stands. (Paint over the political signs if they
are used.)</li></ul></li><li>Place the Equipment
<ul><li>Eye protection should be available in the wait-
ing area. All participants on the range must wear
eye protection</li>
<li>BB Guns – May be on the top of the bench if
using bench rest positions, or on the mat used
for the prone positions. If shooters are shoot-
ing from the free-arm standing position, there
should be some type of stand where the guns
may be placed when not in use.
</li><li>BB’s – Should be between the shooting line
and the ready line under the control of the
rangemaster.</li></ul></li>
