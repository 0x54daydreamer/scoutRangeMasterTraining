              When operating the range, the safety rules must be
              remembered and constantly obeyed.

              <ol>

                <li>If the range is outdoors, fly a red range flag whenever the range is in use. The flag should be
large enough and high enough on a flagpole to
be seen from all approaches to the range.</li>
<li>Shooters reporting to the firing line will be issued
a specific number of BBs and a BB dish that will
be placed in plain sight at the firing point.</li>
<li>>Shooters will be instructed that in case of a mis-
fire the BB gun will be kept pointed at the target.
The instructor will be called. If the malfunction is
due to a broken part, the gun, after being cleared
of BBs, will be removed from the firing line.
</li><li>BB guns must be left with the action open or at
half- cock, in the case of lever action spring-piston
air guns, except when the shooter is in position on
the firing line and has been given the command
to load. (Half-cock position on a lever action
spring-piston air gun is with the lever down, but
without the spring compressed or cocked. To
check to see if the gun is cocked, pull the lever
forward; if there is no pressure on the lever, the
spring is compressed and the gun is cocked.)
</li><li>As soon as the command to cease firing is given,
the BB guns must be opened and placed on the
shooting mat with their muzzles pointing down-
range, actions open or at half-cock, whether or
not the shooter has completed firing all his shots.
This rule must be enforced and obeyed absolutely.
</li><li>In preparing to fire, the targets are first placed in
position. The shooters then take their places on
the firing line. While the first group is firing, the
targets are prepared for the next group of shoot-
ers and they are told their firing point. When the
first group has completed firing and all BB guns
are unloaded and actions open or at half-cock,
the fired targets are taken down and the new
targets set up.</li>
<li>No one, shooter or instructor, is allowed in front
of the firing line after the order has been given
to load and before the order has been given to
cease firingâ€”actions open.</li>
<li>No one is allowed on the firing line except the
shooters and their coaches or instructors.
</li><li>Horseplay of any kind is forbidden on the range.
Spectators and those who are waiting their turn
to fire are not permitted to do anything that may
distract the attention of the shooters from the
business of shooting accurately and safely.
</li><li>All BB guns not in use should be kept in racks
with the actions open or at half-cock.
